Geoconnex is an open, community-contribution knowledge graph designed to link hydrologic features across the United States, making water data easily discoverable, accessible, and usable for researchers, agencies, and water managers. The graph contains over 19.2 million triples describing 1.6 million hydrologic locations including monitoring sites, dams, watersheds, stream networks, and water bodies, with extensive geospatial coverage through 763,000 point geometries and 320,000 polygon features. Built on persistent identifiers and published in accordance with Spatial Data on the Web best practices, Geoconnex harvests JSON-LD metadata from water data providers using common ontologies including schema.org for general metadata, HY-Features for hydrology, and SOSA/SSN for sensor observations. The system enables federation across organizational boundaries by maintaining persistent URIs at that prevent link rot while allowing data publishers to update their resources.
