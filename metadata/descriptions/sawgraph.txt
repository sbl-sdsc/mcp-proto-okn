SAWGraph (Safe Agricultural Products and Water Graph) is a specialized knowledge graph designed for environmental health researchers, regulatory agencies, and public health officials to track per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and other contaminants in food and water systems. The graph integrates contamination measurements from Maine's EGAD drinking water monitoring program and the national Water Quality Portal, linking observations to food products (FOODON taxonomy including meat, dairy, produce, and seafood), geographic locations (administrative regions), and taxonomic entities (NCBITaxon organisms). SAWGraph employs the Contaminoso ontology (COSO) for standardized contamination modeling, connecting to external identifiers via ComptoxAI substance links and CAS numbers. Observations include measurement values, detection limits, lab qualifiers, and validation levels. The knowledge graph is updated with emerging contaminant data to support food safety assessments and regulatory compliance tracking.
