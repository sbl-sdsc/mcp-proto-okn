The SAWGraph Hydrology KG is part of the Safe Agricultural Products and Water Graph (SAWGraph) is an NSF-funded Proto-OKN Theme 1 initiative designed for environmental regulators, water safety officials, and PFAS researchers. This knowledge graph integrates surface water features including stream reaches and watersheds, groundwater features like aquifers, and hydrological connectivity data to support contaminant tracing and water quality analysis. The graph connects to geoconnex and KnowWhereGraph to provide geospatial relations, with locations spatially integrated via S2 cells and administrative regions using FIPS codes and ZIP codes. It enables users to trace pollutant pathways, identify upstream contamination sources, assess downstream impacts from point sources, and determine which water wells are hydrologically connected to contaminated sites. Built on open-source hydrological datasets including the National Hydrography Dataset.
