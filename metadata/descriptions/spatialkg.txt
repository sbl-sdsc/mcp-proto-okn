The SAWGraph Spatial KG is a large-scale geospatial knowledge graph developed by the SAWGraph project for researchers and practitioners working with place-based data and spatial analytics. The graph contains 756.9 million triples describing 16.8 million spatial entities, primarily organized around GeoSPARQL-compliant spatial objects including 7.4 million S2 cells (Level 13 discretization) and hierarchical administrative regions across three levels (102 countries/Level 1, 6,228 Level 2, 35,458 Level 3 units). The knowledge graph leverages the STKO-KWG ontology and implements OGC GeoSPARQL standards, enabling interoperability with other geospatial datasets through standardized vocabularies (owl:, geosparql:, rdf:, rdfs:). Funded by NSF award #2333782, the dataset supports spatial reasoning, place-based linkage, and geographic data integration.
