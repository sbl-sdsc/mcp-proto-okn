The FIO KG is a core component of the SAWGraph (Safe Agricultural Products and Water Graph) project, an NSF-funded Proto-OKN initiative to monitor and trace PFAS and other contaminants in the nation's food and water systems. This knowledge graph integrates comprehensive facility and industry classification data for the coterminous United States from EPA's Facility Registry Service (FRS), which provides an integrated source of environmental information about over 826,000 regulated facilities across air, water, and waste programs. The graph contains 2.6 million entities and over 10 million triples, structuring data around facilities, environmental records (monitoring, permits, enforcement), and NAICS industry codes. Each facility is spatially indexed using S2 cells (Level 13) and linked to environmental interest types, compliance systems, and temporal tracking records. The dataset employs standard vocabularies including Dublin Core, PROV-O, GeoSPARQL, and Schema.org, with strong external links to Data Commons (218K) and STKO-KWG geospatial resources (1.5M). Updated through July 2025, the graph supports SPARQL queries via the FRINK platform for environmental compliance research, contaminant pathway analysis, and facility-industry profiling.
