The Soil Organic Carbon Knowledge Graph (SOCKG) serves agricultural researchers, carbon market operators, and climate scientists by consolidating fragmented soil carbon datasets into a unified semantic framework. SOCKG contains detailed agricultural experimental data including tillage events, crop rotations, fertilizer amendments, soil measurements (chemical and biological samples), weather observations, and greenhouse gas flux measurements across multiple sites and treatments. The graph models agricultural management practices (planting, grazing, irrigation, residue management) and their relationships to soil organic carbon dynamics using a custom ontology (idir.uta.edu/sockg-ontology). SOCKG links to external vocabularies including Schema.org for organizations and people, Dublin Core for bibliographic metadata, GeoSPARQL for spatial data, QUDT for units and measurements, and the USDA National Agricultural Library Thesaurus (NALT).
