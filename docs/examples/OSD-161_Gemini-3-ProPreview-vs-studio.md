## 6. Narrative Summary
The OSD-161 study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the adrenal gland of mice (Rodent Research 3). The adrenal gland is a critical organ for stress response. 

**Molecular Findings**:
The analysis revealed a significant upregulation of immediate early genes and stress-inducible factors such as ***Fos*** (c-Fos) and ***Dusp1***. These genes are classic markers of cellular stress and neuronal activation. Conversely, there was a downregulation of immune-related genes, particularly MHC Class I components (***H2-Q6***, ***H2-Q7***) and antigen presentation machinery (***Cd74***, ***Cd72***), suggesting a possible suppression of immune surveillance functionality in the adrenal tissue during spaceflight. Additionally, ***Gad1***, the rate-limiting enzyme for GABA synthesis, was downregulated.

**Translational Relevance**:
Mapping these findings to human disease networks via SPOKE highlights potential health risks. 
*   **Mental Health & Neurology**: The upregulation of *FOS* and downregulation of *GAD1* link strongly to neuropsychiatric conditions. *FOS* is associated with **Anxiety** and **Depression**, while *GAD1* deficits are hallmarks of **Schizophrenia**, **Epilepsy**, and **Autism**. This suggests that spaceflight-induced stress signaling and GABAergic dysregulation in the adrenal gland (or systemic effects reflected there) could contribute to neurobehavioral phenotype changes or stress-related disorders.
*   **Metabolic & Immune**: *FOS* is also linked to **Diabetes** and **Inflammatory Bowel Disease**, pointing to systemic inflammatory and metabolic stress.

This multi-omic integration suggests that spaceflight triggers a stress response coupled with immune suppression and alterations in pathways critical for neurological health.
