The graph integrates 87 social service organizations with their locations, contact information, and 87 distinct service offerings, structured using Schema.org vocabulary for interoperability. It contains 32,460 triples across 1,764 entities, primarily modeling service availability (609 opening hours specifications), service categories (157 CategoryCodes), and target audiences (81 audience types). Data is extensively linked to Aunt Bertha's social services directory (1,392 external references) and employs W3C PROV ontology for provenance tracking of all entities through transformation activities. Services are geocoded with latitude/longitude, categorized by populations served (abuse survivors, adults, teens, African American communities).",

This knowledge graph integrates comprehensive facility and industry classification data for the coterminous United States from EPA's Facility Registry Service (FRS), which provides an integrated source of environmental information about over 826,000 regulated facilities across air, water, and waste programs. The graph contains 2.6 million entities and over 10 million triples, structuring data around facilities, environmental records (monitoring, permits, enforcement), and NAICS industry codes. Each facility is spatially indexed using S2 cells (Level 13) and linked to environmental interest types, compliance systems, and temporal tracking records. The dataset employs standard vocabularies including Dublin Core, PROV-O, GeoSPARQL, and Schema.org, with strong external links to Data Commons (218K) and STKO-KWG geospatial resources (1.5M). Updated through July 2025, the graph supports SPARQL queries via the FRINK platform for environmental compliance research, contaminant pathway analysis, and facility-industry profiling.",

It connects datasets to their authors, funding sources, research projects, publications, and key disease and pathogen terms, facilitating discovery of resources related to COVID-19, HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases. By harmonizing heterogeneous metadata formats and providing both user-friendly search interfaces and programmatic API access, the NDE knowledge graph accelerates IID research and maximizes the impact of publicly-funded scientific data.",

SOCKG contains detailed agricultural experimental data including tillage events, crop rotations, fertilizer amendments, soil measurements (chemical and biological samples), weather observations, and greenhouse gas flux measurements across multiple sites and treatments. The graph models agricultural management practices (planting, grazing, irrigation, residue management) and their relationships to soil organic carbon dynamics using a custom ontology (idir.uta.edu/sockg-ontology). SOCKG links to external vocabularies including Schema.org for organizations and people, Dublin Core for bibliographic metadata, GeoSPARQL for spatial data, QUDT for units and measurements, and the USDA National Agricultural Library Thesaurus (NALT).",

The knowledge graph introduces \"Risk-Points\u2122\"\u2014locations where built and natural environments interact with potential flood impacts\u2014providing 24-year historical analysis coverage across the continental United States. UF-OKN uses schema.org vocabularies (Place, GeoShape, GeoCoordinates, Observation, PropertyValue) and STKO spatial ontologies (S2Cell) to enable SPARQL queries connecting infrastructure vulnerability to forecast conditions.

    "description_summary": "Wildlife-KN is a comprehensive knowledge network designed for wildlife researchers, conservation managers, and policymakers addressing biodiversity challenges under climate change. The graph integrates data on wildlife species, habitat characteristics, environmental variables, geographic distributions, and climate projections to enable cross-domain analysis of how changing conditions affect wildlife populations and ecosystems. Built to support interdisciplinary inquiry, Wildlife-KN links biological observations with geospatial, temporal, and climatological data, facilitating queries about species vulnerability, habitat suitability shifts, and conservation prioritization. The knowledge graph employs standard semantic web vocabularies (RDFS, SKOS, Schema.org, GeoSPARQL) and cross-links to authoritative biodiversity databases, enabling federation with other OKN Theme-1 resources.",
